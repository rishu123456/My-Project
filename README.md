**Approach and Thought Process**:
The Task Management Application allows users to:
Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
Sort tasks by priority, date, or time.
Filter tasks based on their completion status.
The UI is built using React components with state management handled by React's useState. The app leverages forms to capture task data and buttons for interaction. We use conditional rendering for the task list and create/edit forms.

**Tools Used**:
React: For building the UI components.
React Router: For handling navigation (optional for task details).
CSS: For styling the components.
Jest: For running unit tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
React Testing Library: For testing the UI components.
